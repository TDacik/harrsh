-----------------

Java JDK 8 is needed to compile HARRSH.

2. Install sbt
--------------

Install sbt; see http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html for instructions.

3. Get the source
-----------------

git clone https://bitbucket.org/jkatelaan/harrsh.git
cd harrsh

4. Compile

You can now build an executable for HARRSH via

./build.sh

This will fetch dependencies and compile the source code, which might take several minutes.

When build.sh has finished, you should find an executable ./harrsh in the
same directory as this file.

./harrsh --help

To update to a newer revision, simply run

git pull

and run ./build.sh again.
