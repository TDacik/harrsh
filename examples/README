This folder contains several benchmarks suites (*.bms) relying on our own benchmarks (in examples/datastructures,
examples/symbolicheaps) as well as benchmarks that were taken from the Cyclist tool (in examples/cyclist).

Run
  $ ./harrsh.sh --batch examples/esop-benchmarks.bms --timeout 300
to reproduce the evaluation results of our ESOP'17 paper
