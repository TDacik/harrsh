Some benchmark suites include predicate definitions distributed with the Cyclist tool (http://www.cyclist-prover.org/).
To run these benchmarks with our tool, clone the Cyclist repository (https://github.com/ngorogiannis/cyclist)
and copy the content of
  cyclist/benchmarks/slsat/cc/ and
  cyclist/benchmarks/slsat/syn/
into the current folder (i.e., harrsh/examples/cyclist).
